       {"agent": "StrategyPilot", "pattern": "StepwiseInsightSynthesis"},
       {"agent": "NarrativeArchitect", "pattern": "RoleDirective"},
       {"agent": "EvaluatorAgent", "pattern": "PatternCritiqueThenRewrite"}
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **Critique Strategy**
   ```json
   {
     "name": "critique_strategy",

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Input Format**
   ```
   {
     "domain": "payment_systems | user_authentication | analytics_dashboard",
     "mode": "simulate | ship | critique",
     "requirements": "Detailed requirements text",
     "context": {
       "user_type": "technical | business | mixed",
       "priority": "security | usability | performance",
       "constraints": ["constraint1", "constraint2"]
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Output Format**
   ```
   {
     "solution": {
       "overview": "High-level description",
       "components": ["component1", "component2"],
       "implementation": {
         "steps": ["step1", "step2"],
         "considerations": ["consideration1", "consideration2"]
       }
     },
     "metrics": {
       "clarity": 0.0-1.0,
       "innovation": 0.0-1.0,
       "effectiveness": 0.0-1.0
     },
     "reasoning_trail": [
       {
         "step": 1,
         "agent": "agent_name",
         "pattern": "pattern_name",
         "output": "step output"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

3. **Best Practices**
   - Start with SIMULATE mode for exploration
   - Use CRITIQUE mode for refinement
   - Switch to SHIP mode for final output
   - Monitor pattern metrics for quality
   - Review reasoning trails for insight
   - Leverage chain templates for consistency

## Example Usage

1. **Payment System Design**
   ```
   Input: "Design a real-time payment verification system"
   Mode: SIMULATE
   Chain: provocation_loop
   ```

2. **Security Analysis**
   ```
   Input: "Analyze authentication system security"
   Mode: CRITIQUE
   Chain: critique_strategy
   ```

3. **UX Improvement**
   ```
   Input: "Optimize dashboard user experience"
   Mode: SHIP
   Chain: rewrite_evolution
   ```

Remember:
1. Always consider Block's security and compliance requirements
2. Focus on user experience and system reliability
3. Maintain clear documentation and reasoning trails
4. Use appropriate patterns for the task context
5. Monitor and respond to quality metrics
6. Leverage the fallback system when needed
